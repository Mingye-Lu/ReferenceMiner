# MLA Formatting Rules

# **1. Paper Formatting (General Document Rules)**

**1.1 Page Layout**

* One-inch margins on **all sides** (top, bottom, left, right).([Lone Star College Library Guides][2])
* Use an **easily readable font** (e.g., **12 pt Times New Roman**).([Lane Community College Library Guides][3])
* **Double-space** all text, including block quotations, notes, and Works Cited list.([Lane Community College Library Guides][3])
* **Do not justify** the right margin; leave text left-aligned (ragged right).([Widener University Library Guides][4])

**1.2 Paragraphs and Indentation**

* **First line of each paragraph**: indent ½ inch from left margin.([Lane Community College Library Guides][3])
* **Block quotes** (long quotes of 4+ lines): indent entire quote ½ inch from left margin.([Widener University Library Guides][4])

**1.3 Headers and Page Numbers**

* Include a **running header** in the top right of every page: **Last Name + page number**.([Lone Star College Library Guides][2])

**1.4 First Page (No Title Page by Default)**

* On the **first page**, in upper left corner, list **(double-spaced)**:

  1. Your Name
  2. Instructor’s Name
  3. Course Name/Number
  4. Date (Day Month Year; e.g., 22 January 2026)([Lone Star College Library Guides][2])

# **2. In-Text Citations**

MLA uses **parenthetical (author–page) citations** linked directly to full references in the Works Cited list.([Purdue Owl][1])

**2.1 Basic Parenthetical Format**

* Put author’s **last name and page number** (no comma) in parentheses:

  * Example: (Smith 37).([Towson University Library Guides][5])

**2.2 Placement**

* Citation goes **directly after** the quoted or paraphrased material and **before the period** (for normal quotes; block quotes place the citation after the final punctuation).([Purdue Owl][6])

**2.3 Author Named in Prose**

* If the author’s name appears in the sentence, include **only the page number** in parentheses:

  * Example: Smith argues this point (37).([Purdue Owl][6])

**2.4 Multiple Authors**

* Two authors: list both (e.g., **(Moore and Patel 48–50)**).
* Three or more authors: use **et al.** after the first author’s name (e.g., **(Moore et al. 59)**).([scribbr.com][7])

**2.5 No Page Numbers**

* If no page numbers are available, include only author’s name (or title if no author).([Penn State Libraries Guides][8])

**2.6 Multiple Citations or Sources**

* If citing multiple sources in one place, separate with **semicolons**:

  * (Garcia 64; Davies 14).([scribbr.com][7])

**3.2 Alphabetical Order**

* List entries **alphabetically by author’s last name** (or title if no author).([Golden West College LibGuides][9])
